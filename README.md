# Materials about CUDA and GPU programming in general


## Books sorted by how interesting they seem to me at first glance

- 2014-professional-cuda-c-programming.pdf
- 2023-programming-massively-parallel-processors.pdf
- 2010-cuda-by-example.pdf
- 2019-learn-cuda-programming.pdf
- 2015-cuda-for-engineers.pdf


It seems that 2014-professional-cuda-c-programming.pdf focuses on CUDA programming and goes straight to the technicalities while using plain C.
2023-programming-massively-parallel-processors.pdf seems to have a broader scope. I feel it tries to map problems to the GPU programming model and teach some CUDA occasionally.
The remaining books seem OK.
